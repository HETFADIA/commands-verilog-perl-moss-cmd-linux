To run the file:
iverilog filename.v

To run on testbench:
iverilog FGPA.v testbench.v

To execute it:
vvp a.out




To run waveform:
gtkwave ha.vcd(where the file was dumped)


Executing on edaplayground:
1) Put your code in design.sv
2) Put your test bench in testbench.v
3) Put your mem files in +
4) Select language icarus verilog 0.10.0 ...
5) Save and run
6) Tick Open EPWave after run if not
7) You can also select many from drop down


Error part:
Part 1):
If you get error as 
testbench.v:12: error: reg lab5_output; cannot be driven by primitives or continuous assignment.
testbench.v:12: error: Output port expression must support continuous assignment.
testbench.v:12:      : Port 4 (out_final) of universal_shift_register is connected to lab5_output
2 error(s) during elaboration.

change reg to wire

Part 2):
1) I give up
Check brackets




Problems:
1) In verilog the bit from mem will be selected from right to left in configure.mem
	For example if you select mem[{0,0,0,0,0}] from mem AAAAAAAA then 0th bit from right ie 0 will be selected
