Save the main file on github with name index.html

Then go to settings and then scroll down to github pages:
1) In the source select Master from none
2) Save

Refresh the page 3 times and then the link will be ready


Error part:
1)Remember there should be only one index file
If there is index.js file then the page will not be found (Error:404)

2) If the error is not gone move js files to js folder

3) Still if there is a error remove all the comments on all files and then check
