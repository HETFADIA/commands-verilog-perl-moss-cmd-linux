When c0 is 0 last bit is selected because we want shift right(previous bit)
Also in1 is previous bit
When c0 is 1 last second bit is selected beacause we want shift left(next bit)
Also in2 is previous bit

Here when control is 0 the c0 is 0 when retain is there
the output is in3(retain)
When the control is 1 the c0 is 1 when load data is there
the output is in4(data_load)
